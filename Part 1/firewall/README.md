This is intended for use in the following VM provided by UCT lecturer Joyce Mwangama:
	https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhrx3av0rwtkexd/eee4121f-b%20with%20p4.ova?dl=0

The code can be run with the following command:
	'sh run.sh'

To run the simulation, make the required changes to firewall-policies.csv,
	and then, when the mininet prompt appears, run:
		'pingall'

Trouble shooting:
	Prefix commands with 'sudo'
